High-Tempo 2v2 Back Checking Drill for Hockey,https://weisstechhockey.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2v2-Continuous-Backcheck-1024x490.png,https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQl4oILv5Q4?feature=oembed,Weiss,"1 on 1's, 2 on 2's, 2 on 1's, 3 on 2's",,,"Elevate Your Team’s Game with the Two Versus Two Continuous Back Check Drill
Hockey is a fast-paced, high-intensity sport that demands not only skill and speed but also a relentless work ethic, especially when it comes to defensive play. One of the most critical yet often under-practiced aspects of hockey is back checking—the art of hustling back to defend after a turnover or offensive rush. To help coaches and players master this essential skill, Jeremy Weiss of Weiss Tech Hockey introduces a dynamic and engaging drill: the Two Versus Two Continuous Back Check Drill.
This drill is designed to simulate real-game scenarios in a confined space, pushing players to their limits while making the learning process enjoyable. Let’s break down the setup, execution, and benefits of this high-tempo drill, and explore how it can transform your team’s approach to back checking and overall defensive play.
Back checking is the backbone of effective team defense. It’s the effort players put in to recover after losing possession, racing back to disrupt the opposition’s attack. Strong back checking can be the difference between a scoring chance against and a successful defensive stand. It requires speed, awareness, and a commitment to team play.
Many teams struggle with consistent back checking, especially in youth and amateur hockey. Players may not fully grasp its importance, or they may lack the conditioning to execute it effectively throughout a game. Drills that emphasize back checking in a fun, competitive environment can help bridge this gap.
The Two Versus Two Continuous Back Check Drill is a confined-space, high-intensity exercise that combines offensive rushes with immediate defensive transitions. It’s designed to keep players moving at full speed, simulating the quick changes of possession that occur in real games.
The drill’s confined space and rapid transitions closely mimic the pace and pressure of actual games. Players learn to make decisions under duress and adapt quickly to changing situations.
With constant sprints and minimal rest, players build endurance and explosiveness. This translates directly to better performance in games, especially late in periods when fatigue sets in.
By repeatedly transitioning from offense to defense, players develop a stronger sense of responsibility and anticipation. They learn to recognize when to back check and how to position themselves to disrupt the opposition.
The two-on-zero rushes give players opportunities to practice quick passes, creative plays, and finishing skills—all under the pressure of back checkers closing in.
The drill fosters communication and teamwork, as players must work together on both sides of the puck. It also builds a culture of accountability, where everyone is expected to contribute defensively.
If players are coasting on the back check, remind them that the drill’s purpose is to simulate game-speed transitions. Consider adding incentives or consequences to encourage maximum effort.
Ensure players know when to switch from offense to defense. Use clear signals (whistle, verbal cue) and reinforce the timing during walkthroughs.
The drill is demanding. Monitor players for signs of excessive fatigue and adjust rest periods as needed. Rotate groups to keep everyone fresh and engaged.
For older or more advanced teams, consider making it a three-on-two or three-on-three drill. This increases complexity and further challenges players’ decision-making and communication.
Modify the drill to simulate power play or penalty kill situations, giving players experience in different game scenarios.
Keep track of goals, successful back checks, or turnovers to add a statistical element. This can motivate players and provide measurable benchmarks for improvement.
One of the standout features of the Two Versus Two Continuous Back Check Drill is its ability to blend hard work with enjoyment. Players are pushed to their limits, but the competitive, fast-paced nature of the drill keeps them engaged and motivated. When players are having fun, they’re more likely to give maximum effort and retain what they learn.
For those looking to implement this drill and others like it, Weiss Tech Hockey offers a wealth of resources:

The Two Versus Two Continuous Back Check Drill is a powerful addition to any coach’s toolkit. By emphasizing high-tempo transitions, defensive responsibility, and offensive creativity, it prepares players for the demands of real-game situations. Its confined space and continuous flow ensure that every participant is engaged, challenged, and improving with each repetition.
Whether you’re coaching youth hockey or working with advanced players, this drill can help instill the habits and skills necessary for success. Make it a regular part of your practice routine, and watch your team’s back checking—and overall game—reach new heights.

I thought it was a great topic for discussion, and one I’m currently dealing with as well, since I’m working with the same age group on my son’s team. So… as I always say, here’s my two cents worth:
Most 7-year-olds aren’t capable of skating backwards well enough to play a proper 1 on 1. But there are still 1 on 1s in games. So what do you do? Here’s my strategy:

Both sides go at the same time. After the dump in and breakout, both defensemen play 2 on 1 against the other line’s forwards.
1. two forwards swing low and receive a pass from the coach, then step over the center line and dump it in.2. goalie stops the puck for the defenseman, who initiates the breakout, then plays 2 on 1 against forwards from the other line.3. forwards attack 2 on 1 against the defenseman from the other line

After your team gets good at it, try throwing in a forechecker (or two). You can designate where and how you want the forechecking pressure coming in, which will make your defensemen have to read and react to different scenarios.

I’d been playing around with a “new” drill diagrammer I had just come across, DrillDraw, and thought it would be cool to make video explanations of drills using a “digital whiteboard.”
I started by posting a few video explanations of my favorite drills, and things just kinda took off from there! At that time, nobody was doing digital video explanations, and it seemed to be a method of delivery that resonated with coaches.  As things have progressed, we’ve branched out into other aspects of hockey training and development, and the blog has developed into the format you see today.
This week I was doing a bit of reflection, and I got curious as to which of my posts have been the most popular (in terms of page views) over the past 4 years.

QuickStickz is an innovative new way to work on your stickhandling abilities off the ice, and it’s a lot of fun too!
A few months ago I was invited to take a look at QuickStickz, which is a video-game-based, hockey stickhandling development system. I had seen the product before, but I’d never had the chance to get my hands on one. The idea seemed really cool, so I was excited to see what it was all about.
How it Works:QuickStickz uses a special infrared camera that connects up to your PC via USB jack. The camera combos up with a customized SmartHockey stickhandling ball, that has been machined out with a whole bunch of tiny reflectors all over its surface. As you stickhandle, the camera picks up the movements of the ball, and sends the signal into the computer, which allows you to see your stickhandling movements on the screen.
Set-up is pretty simple, just plug in the camera, go to the QuickStickz member’s area, and install the plug-in when prompted.
Drills and Games:Once you’re up and running, just select a drill or a game from the member’s area, and have at it! The drills are designed to help you work on various skills such as tight puck movement, wide puck movement, dekes, toe drags, etc. The games apply these skills in a more dynamic environment.
Member’s Area:The member’s area is a great way to track your progress. You can check your own stats and progress, or see how your top score compares to other top scores from around the world. The member’s area also tracks how much time you’re spending on QuickStickz. This makes it easy for parents or coaches to check in on the player’s efforts and progress.
Conclusion:QuickStickzis a great tool to help any player develop his or her stickhandling abilities. It’s a lot of fun, and it’s a product that I think connects with kids on their level. The one weakness of QuickSticks is that it’s fairly sensitive to the ambient lighting in the room you’re using it in. Sunlight badly interferes with the infrared signal put out by the camera, and makes the ball just jump around on the screen. So make sure you close the blinds, and rely on your “artificial lighting” (regular lightbulbs), and you should be just fine!",[],[],[],True,[],Unknown,Unknown,[],['Stickhandling'],Intermediate

If you cannot manage your angles appropriately, it will be more difficult to make the simple saves.

11 Visual Cues: Sequence 11 & 11 – Goal Line2 & 10 – Board-side Hashmarks3 & 9 – Defensive Zone Dots4 & 8 – Blue Line on the Boards4 & 7 – Neutral Zone Dots6 – Straight up the Middle
11 Visual Cues: Sequence 21. Spray paint lines on the ice that match up with the visual cues2. Set up pucks further out along the visual cues (spray paint dots to keep the set-up)3. Players shoot from the spray painted dots, goalie uses spray painted lines to judge angles
Notes:In this drill I discuss marking the ice using rope and paint.  This is not absolutely necessary to work with the visual cues but will help a younger goalie correct his or her position within a practice.  After doing this once or twice, you shouldn’t have to do it anymore unless the goaltender continues struggling with angles.
Another good idea is to take video of the goalies telescoping in and out.  You can then show them the video so they can see how the angles change while they move in and out at the cue.  This will definitively teach them how angles work.   All of this seems very simple and basic, yet almost all goalies struggle (even some of the most experienced) with angles at some time in their career.  Work on this and you will definitely be a better goalie.

BIG ANNOUNCEMENT: Goalie Drills at Weiss Tech Hockey!!,https://weisstechhockey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/circlewarmup.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/YcFpn01Gc1w?wmode=transparent,Weiss,Goalie,,,"I’ll be honest with you… I don’t have a clue when it comes to training goalies! I can tell them a few basic things that are going wrong, or what openings I’m seeing as a shooter, but I generally have no idea how to get them to FIX it. This has been a bit of a dilemma for me on the blog… seeing as how many of you have requested I make a section on GOALIE DRILLS over the past couple of years.
Well… the waiting is over! I would like to introduce you to Mr. Dennis Hands. Dennis is a great hockey guy, who has the same passion for the game as I do, but with some fabulous expertise in the goalie department. Over the past 5 years, Dennis has had the opportunity to learn from a number of NHL-caliber coaches such as Mike Babcock, Craig Johnson, and Predators’ goalie coach Mitch Korn. Needless to say, he brings a welcomed element of goalie knowledge to the table!
Here’s a brief bio on Dennis, taken from a recent press release about the High School team he coaches:
Dennis brings over 30 years of hockey experience to the team, including 2 years starting goaltender for Jackson Lumen Christi Catholic High School where he led the team to the State quarterfinals and ended his high school career earning 1st team All-State and being invited and playing in the Michigan High School All-Class All Star game. He had a brief stint in the North American Junior Hockey League before moving on to play Division 1 College Club Hockey. Dennis spent 1 year at University of Michigan-Dearborn and 3 years at University of Arizona playing where he was the starting goalie all 2 1/2 years. During his career at U of A he led the team to a 77-19-1 record as well as 3 appearances in the ACHA National Tournament. Dennis won 2 top Goaltender awards during his career at U of A and in 2004 was inducted in the University of Arizona Icecats Hall of Fame.
Dennis has spent the last five years in volunteer coaching rolls within the Jr. Ducks program. He has a certificate in Hockey team management and scouting through the well known Sports Management Worldwide and is a Level III certified coach through USA Hockey.
Dennis has had a successful 12 year business career including roles as software implementation consultant, software sales manager, V.P. of Software Sales and most recently CEO of a Software Sales and Consulting organization. Dennis holds a bachelor’s degree in accounting and currently resides in Southern California with his wife Kristen and two children, Capriana and Carter.
Lastly, here’s a sample of Dennis’ work (great stuff here!):

HockeyVision Training Pucks are white, with a black dot in the middle. The black dot comes in three sizes (large, medium, and small). The idea is to work your way down from the large, more-visible dot to small, less-visible dot, training your eye to not have to see as much of the puck while stickhandling.
These pucks are available in on-ice and off-ice models. The on-ice pucks are made of rubber (same as a regulation puck), and the off-ice ones are made of a high-density plastic (HDPE if I’m not mistaken), which allows them to slide really well on flooring tiles or a skill pad.

Post Awareness Drill,https://weisstechhockey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/postawareness.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/SPoRmWQcmD4?wmode=transparent,Weiss,Goalie,,,"This post awareness drill offers lots of possibilities. If you want to progress past just taking shots on this drill, give the players the option to carry the puck across the net/zone before they shoot.
Here are the goalie’s objectives on this drill:
1. Post Awareness2. Rebound Control and Recovery3. Post Recovery4. Post-knee-up position (Post Load)
Here’s the diagram and drill explanation:
Post Awareness Drill1. Goalie starts on the post2. Player 1 leaves without puck, pivots from forward to backward at about the hashmarks, and receives a pass from Player 23. After receiving the pass, Player 1 pivots and skates forward around the far cone, then drives to the high slot for a shot on goal4. Goalie follows the puck, squaring up to the shot5. After the shot, Player 1 positions himself for a rebound. Goalie gets back to the post with urgency6. Player 2 drives around the middle cone (with puck), and takes shot. Player 1 jumps on the rebound if it’s within the green area7. After Player 2’s shot and rebound, Player 1 gets back in line. Player two positions himself for Player 3’s rebound. Goalie gets back to the post.8. Player 3 drives around the low cone and shoots. Player 2 rebounds, then gets back in line. Player 3 positions himself for a rebound, and the drill repeats.

It is controversial because most goalies do not always use it in the correct situations. This particular drill will work on the Post Knee up as well as work on teaching the goaltender to read and react and utilize the save in the correct situation. Here’s the diagram:
Post-Knee-Up Drill:SEQUENCE 1:1. Goalie starts square to Player 1.2. Player 1 passes low to Player 2, who attacks the net from the side3. Goalie uses Post-Knee-Up positioning4. After the shot, player 2 opens up to the slot for a rebound or a one-time shot5. After Player 2 shoots, Player 1 drives low around the bottom of the circle and either shoots or passes to Player 2
SEQUENCE 2:1. Player 1 walks out of the corner. He/she has 4 options: Shoot; Pass behind the net with Player 2 walking out for the shot; Pass to Player 3 for a one-time shot; Pass to Player 4 for a one-time shot.
Option: If Player 1 passes to Player 2, you can give Player 2 the same 4 options again; Shoot, Pass behind the net, or Pass to Player 3 or 4
Additional Notes:Since this is a reactionary save, make sure when doing this save you keep the following in mind:
1. Close all holes by being very compact2. Use only when the puck is in the low post area and close to the net3. When on glove side, keep your glove in 12 o’clock position, right next to head and wide open.4. Keep your blocker and stick in stance position
During this drill, make sure the goalie is moving. After a goal or a freeze, let the goalie get back into the start position. Hope you enjoy.

The Star Drill,https://weisstechhockey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/stardrill.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sk503LKaFY8?wmode=transparent,Weiss,Goalie,,,"If done correctly, this drill will generate create good habits moving around the crease, and the goalies will become more “Crease Aware” (knowing where they are in their crease). Here’s the diagram, as well as a variation to take the concept to the next level:
The Star DrillGoalie starts at the post, then skates the following sequence (see our post on the11 Visual Targets for Hockey Goalies)1. Position 112. Position 63. Position 94. Position 15. Position 66. Position 37. Back to Position 118. Repeat the opposite way
VariationGoalie performs start drill, reacting to the passes of the three forwards1. Forward on the goal line passes to the forward in the middle, then skates to the near dot2. Goalie reacts by skating to Position 63. Middle forward passes back to the forward who made the first pass4. Goalie reacts by skating to Position 95. Forward on the dot passes across to the forward on the other goal line, then retreats back to his or her original position6. Goalie reacts by skating to Position 17. Goal-line forward passes to middle forward, then skates to near dot8. Goalie reacts by skating to Position 69. Middle forward passes back to the forward who just passed to him10. Goalie reacts by skating to Position 311. Forward on the dot passes back across to the forward on the other goal line (who started the drill), then retreats back to his or her original position
Have the goalies perform this 2-3 times each. As they begin to improve, allow the forwards to shoot at random intervals.
REMEMBER: have the goalie adjust to the rebound if they are not able to cover or trap the puck.  Create good habits, don’t let them just stop the puck and move to the next area.
For more advanced goalies, you can do the same drill but allow the players to move around in a triangle more freely rather than passing and shooting from the designated areas.  When allowing them to move freely in a triangle passing and shooting, they will be working on their offensive attack while giving the goalie a great workout.

Unbelievable Goalie Slide Board,https://weisstechhockey.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/X-Goalie-Crease-Slideboard-2.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/yLQ_-QtIgxM?wmode=opaque,Weiss,Goalie,,,"Every now and then I come across a hockey training product that just makes me go “wow!” That’s what happened when I first saw theX-Goalie Crease Slideboardfrom XHOCKEYPRODUCTS.
Now, I’m admittedly NOT a goalie guy. But it’s not hard to tell when something is going to be beneficial for an athlete. Watch the videos I’ve included in this post, and check out how closely this product allows the goalies to mimic their on-ice movements. Incredible!
Here are a few of the features you should know about:
Regulation-size CreaseThe X-Goalie Crease Slideboard features anNHL regulation goalie creasethat utilizes Fan-tastic Sports technology along with the “ProHybrid Visual Lead Position System.” This system allows a goalie to develop muscle memory using the same Squareness, Angle and Depth as he uses on the ice.
Customizable Movement PatternsThis crease uses adjustable stoppers to create customizable movement patterns. PowerStrides, Shuffles, Pushoffs, Recoveries, Slides and even paddle down wraps can be practiced on our board.
Two Challenging Training LevelsThis crease has two challenging levels: Foundation and Elite. Young goalies will want to start by using the crease at the Foundation Level. This level will allow them to get a feel for the system, and begin to build their leg strength and coordination.
The Elite Level has stopper placements progressively further out as you approach the top angle. This level will challenge even the most established goaltenders due to the precision needed in angle adjustment, and the power it takes to carry the full distance outside the crease.
Stoppers, Pushers, and Recovery BumperAll stoppers are located on the “Awareness to Squareness” lines. Each line gives the goalie/trainer immediate feedback as to whether or not Squareness has been achieved to a specific angle.
In addition to the stoppers, the X-Goalie Crease Slideboard is equipped with a Recovery Bumper. This semi circle railing mirrors the crease line. It is used to execute a recovery or pushoff from your butterfly. The bumper is strategically placed in an ideal position relative to the stoppers for maximum load and power out of your hybrid setup.
Moving in towards the posts you will find two blue net play stance stoppers. These stoppers are placed off of each post to ensure the goalies feet are 30 degrees off the goal line. This 30 degree angle gives the goalie a solid base while allowing him to see the strong side corner while keeping the weak side blue line angle in his or her peripheral vision. The goalie can lead the play with a quick shuffle, come back to the same post, lead again, then rotate and shuffle 30 degrees back to the opposite post.
Lastly, this crease has paddle down wrap recovery bumpers in place. These arched rails enable the goalie to recover out of a paddle down wrap as if a player makes a pass instead of executing a wrap around.
ConclusionI don’t often wish I were a goalie… (No offense to any of you keepers who are reading this!) I love my position, and I play it well. However, this just looks like A LOT of fun to me, and I’m a little envious to tell you the truth! If you’re a goalie… you’ve gotta check this out.
WHERE TO GET IT:Currently the X-Goalie Crease Slideboard is only available atXHOCKEYPRODUCTS.COM… in fact, this product is so new, they’re still in “pre-order” mode right now. But you can sign up to get on the pre-order list here:CLICK HERE TO PRE-ORDER

"""Precision"" Practices, and When to Use Them",https://weisstechhockey.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/quadpass-1024x559.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hclx8eHPPnc?feature=oembed,Weiss,Individual Skill Drills,,,"I was asked to run a practice this past Saturday for my friend who coaches the local high school team. Their playoff schedule had changed, and this practice was scheduled at the last minute. Unfortunately, it was scheduled when he would be out of town with a prior engagement.
Normally, this wouldn’t be a huge deal. But in this case it was. This was what will end up being the last practice of the season. And if the team wins out the rest of their games in playoffs, it will have been the last practice before a stint of 4 games in 7 days. So it needed to be the right kind of practice to suit the needs of the team at this specific moment.
As I was consulting with the head coach, we came to the conclusion that this ought to be a “precision” practice. Meaning, the focus would be on skill details and precision, rather than physicality. We decided to work on passing, timing, shooting, skating & puckhandling, as well as some touch-ups on a few systems elements.
So as I was designing the practice plan, I was thinking in terms of an NHL game-day skate. I wanted it to be a tune-up. We had an hour-and-a-half time slot, so I knew we could take our time and iron out all the wrinkles before rushing to the next drill.
So I put together this practice plan. You can download it here:
Because of the situation, timing of the year, and the fact that I’m not the regular coach, I decided to over plan. So I put in more drills than we would likely get through, and figured I’d adjust in real time based on the needs of the group, and how the skills and concepts were looking.
On a couple of drills, we took less time than budgeted. And on other drills, we took more time, and focused in until they looked good.
We spent quite a bit of time on the drill in the video above. I borrowed this one from a great skills coach namedDanny Heath.  It incorporates short touch passes, agility skating, and some timing elements, then finishes with a shot.
There’s a time and a place for everything. And it’s up to us as coaches to determine what our players need, and when. There are times when you need to have a high intensity “conditioning” practice. There are times when you need to focus on physicality and battling. There are times when systems and positional play need to be addressed. And there are times when you need to dial in the detail elements of the game.
I hope this example helps!

This Circle Passing Drill is a great “interim” drill to build from stationary drills to the more complex stuff described above. It incorporates a bit of movement, and requires more thinking, but isn’t full-blown game pressure.

Product OverviewTheSniper’s Edgefits over any standard two-car garage door opening, and comes in 2 sizes, 7′ x 16′ or 8′ x 16′ (so make sure you measure the height of your garage door before ordering).
The unit comes tightly wrapped in a box – make sure you follow the labeling and DON’T USE A KNIFE TO OPEN THE BOX, as you will risk slicing a hole in your tarp before you even get it open.
InstallationThe Sniper’s Edge doesn’t come with any of the necessary hard-ware to install it. So you’ll need to pick up the following items from Home Depot or Lowe’s:
Once you have the proper hardware, assembly is pretty easy… Just follow the directions included in the box. I put it up myself in about 22 minutes, and it would have been a lot quicker if I had had a partner.
My ExperienceOnce your Sniper’s Edge is all set up, just grab aShooting Pad, somePucks, and have at it! This set-up works really well in neighborhood or indoor settings, where you don’t want errant pucks damaging houses, windows, or other valuable items. The Sniper’s Edge is a tarp, so everything hits with a dead bounce and drops straight down.
Another cool feature on the Sniper’s Edge is the pocketing system. Anytime you snipe a corner, the puck is caught in the back pocket, and drops down to the bottom of the unit, making clean-up easy (as long as you’re hitting the corners!).

It is not uncommon to see young players buzzing around in practices or games – they appear to only have one speed: FULL SPEED.
Since they’re working hard, they think they’re doing a good job… In reality, it is the player who arrives in theright spot, at the right time, with speedthat will be the most effective.
Teach your players to pass to designated receiving areas, not necessarily to players. The responsibility lies with thereceiverto make the play work. The receiver must select the proper route to the receiving zone so that he or shearrives on time, with speed. He or she must be ready to receive the puck when thepasseris ready to move the puck, that’s timing!

The problem is that skating ability is SO essential… you HAVE to find ways of developing it! One method I’ve found to work with youngsters––and older players too :)–is to add a shot at the end of a skating drill. This tactic turns it from a skating drill into a shooting drill, and is much more fun and motivating for the players.
Start with no pucks. As your players progress, add a puck, then start making them do 5 push-ups for each time they lose the puck. Players must be able to execute these skating maneuvers at full speed without mishandling the puck. Add more pressure by assigning push-ups if the next player in line catches you.

Passing: Extreme Passing Kit,https://weisstechhockey.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/DSC_0020.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/3CyM_PjzeZo?wmode=opaque,Weiss,Individual Skill Drills,,,"Passing is a skill that most players don’t think about working on away from the rink. The main reason they don’t think to work on passing is pretty obvious: because you need a partner to pass to, and to receive passes from… Unless, of course, you have the Extreme Passing Kit.
Overview:The Extreme Passing Kit is a really cool skill pad & passing rebounder combo, that will let you work on multiple skills such as regular passes, touch passes, and one-time shots.
The Extreme Passing Kit comes in two different models, theOne-Timer Model(which you see in this video), and theBungee Cord Model. The only difference between the two is that the rebounder is removable in the One-Timer Model, and can be mounted onto anothershooting pad, or even yourdryland flooring tiles. This feature gives you a little more flexibility than you have with the Bungee Cord Model.
On the Bungee Cord Model, the rebounding bungee is mounted right onto the skill pad, making the unit completely self contained (which has it’s benefits as well, in my opinion).
Both models use the4×8′ roll-up shooting pad(huge!), which is light weight, durable, and portable. You can easily roll it up for storage when you aren’t using it, or pack it in the car to bring it to a new dryland training location.
My Experience:The Extreme Passing Kit comes already rolled up for you. When I first unboxed mine, it had retained the shape of being rolled up (which is to be expected), and I had to sort of “pry” it open and “reverse roll” it a bit on the ends to keep it from rolling back up on me. I let it sit out on my driveway in the hot sun for about an hour, and it flattened right out.
Once the shooting pad had flattened out, I mounted the rebounder to one end (it just clamps on), and went to town!
One thing you’ll notice about the Extreme Passing Kit is that it works really well with pretty much any type of puck. I’ve used mine with regular black pucks, FlyPucks, and Green Biscuits, all of which slide really well, and stay flat off the rebounder. In fact, the pucks stayed flat enough that I was actually able to work some one-touch passes as well (which actually surprised me a little).
Conclusion:In conclusion, theExtreme Passing Kitis definitely a worthwhile product to add to your Home Hockey Training Center. It is well built, versatile, portable, and the surface area of the skill pad is big enough to use it for shooting, stickhandling, or passing.",[],[],[],True,[],Unknown,Unknown,[],"['Passing', 'Shooting', 'Stickhandling']",Intermediate

Construction:The Rick O’Shay is made of super durable plastic, which will hold up to your hardest shots.

The Rick O’Shay is fastened to the net with bungee cords that fit between molded channels, which provide a shield against shots.
Design:The most obvious difference between the Rick O’Shay and most other hockey targeting systems is the fact that the Rick O’Shay is a 3-dimensional model. This design gives a more realistic shooting experience, and provides for infinite rebound possibilities. One of my favorite design features is the glove pocket. If you’re trying to go upper right, and miss, your puck might land in the goalie’s glove, stopping play while you fish it out. The Rick O’Shay also features a more “up-to-date” hole set-up, which more closely resembles the open areas you’d see against a butterfly goalie.
Usability:All in all, the Rick O’Shay is a great targeting system, and is especially useful in drop-in situations where goalies can be scarce.

Shooting: My Favorite Off-ice Shooting Drill,https://weisstechhockey.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSC_0073-1024x682.jpg,,Weiss,Individual Skill Drills,,,"When I was in high school, we had ahockey net and backstopout in my parents’ side yard. We also had aShooter Tutorstrapped up to the net, with about100 pucks. Almost everyday my buddy and I would shoot pucks together. To keep it entertaining, most of the time we’d play a game called P.I.G.
P.I.G. is really fun, and can be played on or off the ice. Here’s how it works…
The Rules:P.I.G. works a lot like H.O.R.S.E. in basketball, except that it’s a shorter game, so it’s a little more intense. Basically, a player calls his or her shot. The shots can be any typical shot, or you can get creative and start calling posts or crossbar, forehand, backhand, or even specifying shot type. If that player makes the shot, then the other player has to match it. If the other player misses, he or she gets a letter.
The player who called the first shot keeps calling shots until he or she misses the called shot (you don’t get a letter if you miss your own called shot). At that point it’s the other player’s turn to call a shot, and the process repeats itself.
You get two chances on the last letter.
In this video, my good friend Brett Fuller and I play a high-stakes game of P.I.G., to make it a little more interesting, the loser has to ride the bull (Happy Gilmore style) on camera. With so much on the line, neither of us wanted to lose!
I love putting a little additional pressure into practice drills––even off the ice! It gets you used to performing in clutch situations. Putting something embarrassing on the loser is definitely a fun way of doing this!

Skating: PowerSlide Hockey Slide Board,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QLW960hKmc?wmode=opaque,Weiss,Individual Skill Drills,,,"A while back I was talking to one of my coaching buddies about some of the cool off-ice training equipment that is available these days. I mentioned something about combining ahockey slide boardwith astickhandling skill pad, and how it would be cool to be sliding back and forth while stickhandling, passing, shooting, or anything else.
At the time I thought my idea was completely original… but, it turns out that innovative hockey coaches have had their players doing this for years!
What You Get, and Set-up:So… here’s what I did. I picked up the PowerSlide slide board from HockeyShot. It’s a really high quality slide board that is portable, so you can take it places; adjustable, so you can use with athletes of various sizes and abilities; durable, so it’ll hold up to a lot of usage; and super grippy, so it won’t slide around on you.
The first thing I did was watch the free DVD that came with the PowerSlide. The DVD was very helpful for instructions on putting the PowerSlide together, but the exercise instructions and demos were a little weak to be totally honest. You’ll be better off just using your own creativity to develop your own set of exercises. Plus, as a hockey player or coach, I’m sure you’ve got no shortage of skating drills that can be transferred to the PowerSlide!
Set up was a breeze. I unrolled the PowerSlide, attached the adjustable end piece so that it was a good length for me, tightened it down, and I was all set.
The PowerSlide consists of two end-piece assemblies (where you’ll be pushing off from), and a flexible slide mat. There’s an interesting design feature that I quite like on the PowerSlide. The end piece assemblies aren’t just flat, like most other slide boards. They are made using solid rubber “ramps” that enhance the grip underneath the slide board, and improve the pushing angle of your stride. This feature allows you to stride really hard, but stay very stable in the process.
The PowerSlide also comes with a carrying bag, and a set of booties to wear over-top of your shoes.
My Experience:I decided to use my PowerSlide on top of my Dryland Flooring Tiles, which gave me tons of room for stickhandling and passing. It worked REALLY well! The only thing that surprised me was that the PowerSlide was SO grippy that they were causing the Dryland Tiles to shift a little bit against the garage floor!
Once I slid the tile set-up into the corner, it anchored itself down a bit better, and I didn’t slide anymore.
Using the PowerSlide was amazing… not only was it a lot of fun, but it was a FANTASTIC workout! In fact, you can see a bit of sweat on my face at the end of my video review 🙂 What’s even better though, is that it felt A LOT like the real thing. I was able to work on all sorts of skating, passing, and stickhandling combos, all in the “comfort” of my own garage!
Conclusion:This was one of the funnest, most realistic set-ups I’ve had the chance to mess around with, and I definitely recommend adding this to your Home Hockey Training Center.
If you decide to pick up the PowerSlide, I would HIGHLY recommend grabbing a few other items while you’re at it… Here’s a quick list for you:

Stickhandling: Attack Triangle,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNOiCIX7tOA?wmode=opaque,Weiss,Individual Skill Drills,,,"A number of years ago, one of my coaching buddies told me he had just bought 10 Attack Triangles to use for his team. I took a look, but didn’t totally see the value. I thought it looked a little gimmicky, and it seemed like it would be a hassle to bring that many on the ice each practice.
It wasn’t until a couple of months ago that I actually got the chance to use the Attack Triangle, and when I did, I liked it a lot!
The TheoryTheAttack Triangleis designed to mimic a defenseman in a 1 on 1 stance. You’ve got the stick and two skates, and they’re positioned exactly where a real player would have them. The fact that it’s a 3-dimensional model makes for a more realistic experience for your players. For example, if you start your move too late, you’ll hit the the stick and lose the puck. If you don’t pull your stick back in time, it’ll get caught up in the Attack Triangle’s stick, and once again, you’ll lose the puck.
Off-Ice TrainingA big part of effective stickhandling practice is just getting your reps in, plain and simple. This is where off-ice training with a tool like the Attack Triangle can come in REALLY handy. Instead of having a partner stand there, mimicking a defensman’s stance for countless reps, you just set up the Attack Triangle, and go to town. I definitely recommend getting one or two of these for your off-ice training center.
On-Ice BenefitsThis training tool can also work in your favor as a coach during practices. In the past, I’ve often had a coach offer “token” resistance in a stickhandling drill, and basically stand in the way, in a defensive stance, and let players make moves around him… maybe you’ve done the same? While this method can work, it’s taking at least one coach completely out of the equation! Now instead of coaching, he’s playing “token defense.” Definitely not the best use of personnel in my opinion. Why not throw down an Attack Triangle and let your coaches be free to coach?
ConclusionTheAttack Triangleis a really good tool, with a lot of possible uses. In my mind, having one or two for your off-ice training center is a no-brainer. It will help you to develop your dekes and moves in ways that are much more realistic. On the ice, I also see many uses for the Attack Triangle.

Stickhandling: Green Biscuit Review,,,Weiss,Individual Skill Drills,,,"My First Experience with the Green BiscuitI’ve gotta admit, the first time I saw theGreen Biscuitonline, I didn’t get it. It seemed a little weird, and kinda “gimmicky” to me.
Then, a few months ago I saw one at my local hockey shop. I picked it up off the counter, and asked Darren, the store owner, what he thought of it. He told me it was amazing, and that he’d never seen anything like it. I’ve been friends with Darren for years, so when he tells me “I’ve never seen anything like this,” I usually perk my ears up! Here are his exact words:
“Jeremy, that puck is the damnedest thing… it feels EXACTLY like a real puck, even out there on the parking lot. I’ve never seen anything like it! You’ve gotta get out there and let me show you this!”
So we grabbed a couple of old sticks from the back and went outside to the parking lot. Darren was right! TheGreen Biscuitdid behave just like a real puck. In fact, I’d NEVER seen a puck stay so flat while passing across such a bumpy surface. We messed around in the parking lot for a bit. The more I used the Green Biscuit, the more impressed I became with it… I started passing harder and harder, trying to “test the limits” of the puck. I was thinking at higher passing speeds, it would surely skip up if it hit a rock or something. Nope! It just stayed flat.
After a few minutes of really zinging it back and forth, Darren told me to try throwing some sauce. So of course, I took the invitation… once again, I was amazed. I threw Darren a saucer pass, and the Green Biscuit floated nice and flat through the air, then hit the ground AND STUCK! Before long, Darren and I had spread way out, and were firing saucer passes across the parking lot at each other. Needless to say, I was sold.
Dissecting the Green BiscuitThe reason the Green Biscuit works so well is because of the design. It’s about the same size as a regulation puck, but it’s about an ounce lighter (when friction is factored in, it feels about the same as a regulation puck feels on the ice). Next, the middle is recessed, so contact points with the surface are minimized. In fact, you can see the wear marks on my puck cover about a 2 mm area around the outer edge of the puck.
The most interesting design element is the Green Biscuit’s two-piece, “hinged” assembly. Three metal dowels hold the two halves of the green biscuit loosely together. There are foam cushions in the middle that dampen any bumps. This set-up acts a lot like shock absorbers in a car, with the bottom half of the puck having the flexibility of “adjusting” to the bumps in the surface.
ConclusionThis is a really fun puck to mess around with. If you have the chance, take theGreen Biscuitout and give it a whirl. It’s so much fun to use, you might lose track of time once you get passing it around (that’s what happened to me at least!). I had so much fun shooting the footage for this video review, that I took a lot longer to make it than I needed too. It’s a great puck to use for stickhandling on just about any surface, and it’s even more impressive when you start working on passing. I definitely give the Green Biscuit two thumbs up!",[],[],[],True,"['Forward', 'Defence']",All Zones,All Zones,[],['Stickhandling'],Intermediate
Stickhandling: SmartHockey Ball Review,,,Weiss,Individual Skill Drills,,,"Every once in a while a hockey product comes along that just makes sense. TheSmartHockey Stickhandling Ballis one of those products. I’ve been using the Smart Ball for about 7 years now, and I’ve really enjoyed it. There are a few reasons why the Smart Ball is such an effective stickhandling tool.
Versatility and DurabilitySince it’s a ball, the Smart Ball can be used on many different surfaces. You can take it inside and use it on carpet, bring it to the rink and use it on the rubber flooring there (I keep a Smart Ball in my bag to use for warming up my hands before games), or you can use it outside on the pavement. The Smart Ball is durable enough to withstand whatever abuse you might throw at it. In fact, I still have my original Smart Hockey Stickhandling Ball that I bought 7 years ago, and it’s still in GREAT shape. These balls just don’t wear out!
Smart DesignThe Smart Hockey Ball really lives up to its name when it comes to it’s design. They really did their homework with this product. Here are a few of the key features that I think really add to the off-ice stickhandling experience of the Smart Ball:
ConclusionAll in all, this is a fantastic ball to add to your stickhandling tool set. Not only is it extremely versatile, durable, and well-designed, but it’s a lot of fun to use too, which means it’ll actually GET used! I recommend picking up 2 or 3Smart Balls, one for your bag, and a couple to have at home in your dryland area.

Stickhandling: Swedish Wooden Ball Review,,,Weiss,Individual Skill Drills,,,"In most areas of athletic development there are drills and products to work on raw strength, and there are drills and products designed to work on speed and agility. Think of the difference between a boxer punching the heavy bag vs. the speed bag, or the difference between squats and sprints. Well, stickhandling is no different.
We use different pucks, balls, and other training tools to work on different aspects of stickhandling skill requirements, in an attempt to put together a “complete development package” that will help the athlete to perform at an optimal level.Heavier pucks and ballswill develop wrist and forearm strength, whilelighter ballswill develop faster hands, and quicker reaction speed. Both types of training are important.
Why it Works:TheSwedish Wooden Ballwas designed help you work on your quick hands. This ball is substantially lighter than a puck, and since its made out of wood, it gives you a real dead bounce, which is what we’re looking for in a hockey training puck or ball.
Since it’s a ball, you’ll be able to use it in more places than with a puck (think rubber flooring at the rink, carpet inside your house, pavement, concrete, etc.) This is a very versatile product.
Conclusion:This is a great, inexpensive tool that will give you some variety in your stickhandling training. I recommend picking up two or three of these balls. One for your hockey bag, and a couple to keep around the house. Then all that’s left is to get creative with it!

Stickhandling: SweetHands,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykIXpmaN2VI?wmode=opaque,Weiss,Individual Skill Drills,,,"If you’ve been following along with our Home Hockey Training Center course, you probably know by now thatversatilityis one of the biggest selling points for me when it comes to selecting hockey training products. I like products that will give me multiple uses, and that can be combined with other products to make an even more creative “work space.”SweetHandsdefinitely fits that criteria!
Features and BenefitsHere are a few of the SweetHands features I thought were noteworthy:
My ExperienceSetting up your SweetHands is easy. The pieces just snap together, and you’re up and running in seconds. I liked being able to choose how many pieces to include in my set-up. As you see in the video, I messed around with a few different combinations to work on different aspects of stickhandling.
I also like how durable this product is. I had seen some durability demos on other videos (kids stepping on the SweetHands “crossbars” with skates), but I wasn’t planning on actually putting hat to the test… However, my rambunctious 4-year-old thought otherwise. I caught him walking tightrope style across the SweetHands unit, AND jumping up onto the crossbars like plyo jumps, and trying to land and balance on them! I’m happy to report, the SweetHands held up to the abuse just fine.
Sweethandsis a pleasure to use. It works really well, and does exactly what it was designed to do. As I was making the video, I kept thinking how much better a stickhandler I would be if I would have had some of these tools available to me as a kid!ConclusionI had a lot of fun putting this post together. SweetHands is a great product, with lots of versatility, and the capability of making you a better hockey player if you use it consistently. It’s lightweight, portable, and easy to put together and take a part.
The drill book and DVD are two added bonuses that are VERY worthwhile! In fact, if it were sold separately (which it’s not), I’d recommend picking up the DVD even if you didn’t get theSweetHandsunit itself, it’s that good! I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to improve their stickhandling off the ice!",[],[],[],True,[],Unknown,Unknown,[],['Stickhandling'],Easy

Synchronized Passing Drill: Improve Full-Speed Passing Skills Without Breaking Stride,https://weisstechhockey.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Synchronizes-Passing-Full-Ice-1024x490.png,https://www.youtube.com/embed/05di0WHx404?feature=oembed,Weiss,Individual Skill Drills,,,"In the world of hockey, mastering the art of passing is critical. Smooth, effective passing can make the difference between a successful play and a missed opportunity. In this guide, I’ll walk you through a quick, simple, yet effective passing drill called “Synchronized Passing.” This drill can be applied to players of all ages and skill levels. Moreover, it offers several variations to keep practices dynamic and challenging.
Synchronized passing aims to teach players to give and receive passes smoothly without breaking stride. The essence of this drill is maintaining close distance between players to ensure precise and efficient passing. You’ll want to focus on moving the puck “tape to tape”—meaning your passes are hitting the sweet spot of your teammate’s stick every single time. As players get better, the drill can be modified to incorporate more distance and different types of passes.
As players become adept at synchronized passing, you can add a shot to the drill for an added layer of complexity:
Butterfly passing is a more advanced iteration of synchronized passing:
While there is value in teaching players to use their backhands, long cross-ice passes on the backhand are low-percentage plays even in professional hockey. For this reason, emphasize sniping hard, accurate forehand passes during the butterfly drill.
The cornerstone of synchronized passing is achieving seamless puck movement. Strive for smooth, uninterrupted strides paired with crisp, accurate passes.
Introduce variations such as changing pass types, increasing distances, or incorporating more shots to keep the drills engaging and challenging. This approach ensures players remain focused and constantly improve their skills.
Synchronized passing is a vital drill for hockey players aiming to refine their passing game. By focusing on close-quarters passing, adding shooting components, and progressing to more complex configurations like butterfly passing, players can significantly enhance their skill set. Mastering these drills not only contributes to individual player development but also fosters better teamwork and communication on the ice.

I’m a strong believer that players who don’t take advantage of off-ice training time are leaving precious skill development on the table. Stickhandling is one of the easiest skills to work on at home.XHockeyProductshas put together a great line of hockey training aids that is both fun and effective, which means players will be more motivated to work on their skills off the ice!
The X-Deviator:TheX-Deviatoris a new take on hockey stickhandling aids. The biggest difference between the X-Deviator and some of the other stickhandling aids out there is that the X-Deviator is adjustable. Each joint on the X-Deviator swivels, this feature opens the door for increased creativity by allowing for an endless variety of configurations.
Size Options:The X-Deviator is available in two sizes; Standard – 7 segments, and Mini – 3 segments. Either can be used on or off the ice. Pick the one that fits your needs and matches the space you have available.
Integration with the X-Line-up:The X-Deviator is part of theX-Line-up. All of the products in the X-Line-up are designed to be used together, and can be configured to work on whatever skill you’re looking to develop. If you already have (or plan to purchase) the X-Tiles, make sure you pick up an X-Pocket to go along with your X-Deviator. The X-Pocket will allow you to hook up your X-Deviator right into your X-Tiles system.
Conclusion:I’ve been a big fan of XHockeyProducts’ X-Line-up for a long time, and the X-Deviator didn’t disappoint! The concept is fantastic, and the product is well put-together. One minor word of advice would be to make sure to tighten the nuts that hold the segments together from time to time. They can get loose from using the X-Deviator and changing configurations. If the nut falls off, the segments come apart. Not a huge deal, but just something to watch out for.

X-Passer Hockey Passing Rebounder,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4vQfZijsR0?wmode=opaque,Weiss,Individual Skill Drills,,,"Over the past few years, a number of Hockey Passing Rebounders have made their way to the off-ice training market. These rebounders offer many fun and effective ways of working on your passing both on and off the ice, and I highly recommend owning one.
The passing rebounder I want to show you in this post is by far and away the best one on the market today. TheX-Passeris a heavy-duty, versatile passing rebounder, that has improved on some of the design flaws of other rebounders that are currently on the market. It’s a lot of fun to use, and it works REALLY well. I’m excited to show you what this is all about, so let’s jump straight in!
First Impressions and Design Features:The first thing that struck me about the X-Passer was it’s weight. This thing is heavy duty! It’s obvious that XHOCKEYPRODUCTS intended this to be used with real pucks, and full-speed passes. The weight and design of the X-Passer make it so you can literally throw it down in the middle of the floor, and fire hard passes at it… and it won’t move around on you. This feature allows you a lot more placement and configuration options, and definitely beats the “clip on” rebounders!
Next, theX-Passeruses a bungee system as its rebounding mechanism. This helps to keep the rebounds true and flat. In fact… it’s almost impossible to have a puck flip up on you, even with HARD passes (something other rebounders have been known to have issues with). So long as you’re sending it in flat, it will always come back at you flat and hard.
Third, the X-Passer has a “retractable spiking system” which allows for easy conversion for on-ice use. All you do is twist the screws in the top of the X-Passer, and spikes pop out the bottom. This feature can open up all kinds of new doors for creativity in practices!
Using the X-Passer:The X-Passer is a blast to use. It’s a lot of fun when things “just work” the way they’re supposed to. I use the X-Passer to work on pretty much every type of pass; forehand and backhand “cushion and sweep,” touch passes, you can even get creative and combine it with other products to work on your saucer passes!
Conclusion:A few people have asked me if the X-Passer is worth the higher price when compared to some of the other, “cheaper” rebounders on the market. In my mind, if you’re serious about your off-ice training, it’s absolutely worth paying a premium for a product that is going to work the way it’s supposed to, and last as long as you’ll need it to. When you pick up yourX-Passer, that’s exactly what you’re getting!",[],[],[],True,[],Unknown,Unknown,[],['Passing'],Intermediate
X-Tiles Flooring System,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/rWZKZTOsu8Q?wmode=opaque,Weiss,Individual Skill Drills,,,"I was recently introduced to a new hockey dryland tile that I’m really excited about. It’s called the X-Tile, and it’s made by XHockeyProducts (yes, the same company that brought you the X-Passer, and the X-Deviator).
If you’re familiar withXHockeyProducts, you already know they are famous for designing heavy duty, smart, & functional hockey training equipment… and this product is no different!
The X-Tiles are not only an awesome flooring product to give you a slick surface for stickhandling, shooting, and passing, but they’re also a fully integrated, hockey training system that works in tandem with many other products! In this review I’ll be showing you how the X-Tiles work, and sharing my experiences with them.
Unboxing:
My first impression of the X-Tiles was that they are actually a really good weight. You don’t want a product like this to be too flimsy, but at the same time, you don’t want it to be too hard to move around. The X-Tiles are a durable, manageable weight.
Size:
The next thing you’ll notice about the X-Tiles is that they’re huge (2 feet by 2 feet!). I always say “the bigger, the better” when it comes to flooring tiles because you want to have the fewest seems possible.
Assembly:
The X-Tiles are REALLY easy to put together AND take a part. This is a big feature in my opinion because it allows for a degree of portability, and gives you the option to change configurations if you want (a feature I have made use of a few times myself).
The easiest way to put together your X-Tile set-up is to lay it out first to get an idea of where everything is going to sit, then tap it all together with a rubber mallet. In the video above, I put together a 15 tile set-up in about 11 minutes.
Add-ons:
One of the coolest features with the X-Tiles System is that you can add on various pieces of equipment to enhance your experience and work on different skills. Here’s a quick list of add-ons you’ll want to consider:
Experience:
As you can see in the video, using the X-Tiles System is A LOT of fun! The tiles are very slick, the seams are very flat, and the pucks slide well on them. The add-ons work really well, and are fully integrated with the tile system. I like the fact that you can easily change configurations or add to your X-Tiles system over time.
The X-Tiles are also pretty “kid proof.” I’ve had my boys using these things every day, and they’ve held up just fine. My kids love it!
Conclusion:
This is definitely a product I stand behind. If you’ve got it in the budget, I’d pick up a few boxes of X-Tiles right up front, along with all the add-ons (check out theWeiss Tech Hockey PackageXHockeyProducts has put together). It’s a fantastic training system that is unlike anything else out there. However, the beautiful thing is that you ARE working with a budget, you can just as easily start basic and then keep adding to it piece by piece as you have the funds.",[],[],[],True,[],Unknown,Unknown,[],[],Easy
