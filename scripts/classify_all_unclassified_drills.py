You are a youth hockey coach helping organize and classify drills for a team of 9‚Äì11 year old players.

Please classify the following drill using ONLY the exact terms provided for each category:

- position: choose one or more from ["Forward", "Defence", "Goalie"]
    ‚Ä¢ Skating, passing, stickhandling drills ‚Üí often involve Forwards and Defence
    ‚Ä¢ Shooting drills ‚Üí often involve all 3 positions
    ‚Ä¢ Goalie-focused drills ‚Üí include "Goalie"

- starting_zone: one of ["Defensive Zone", "Neutral Zone", "Offensive Zone", "All Zones", "Unknown"]
- ending_zone: one of the same values

- situation: choose zero or more from ["Breakout", "Zone Entry", "Power Play", "Penalty Kill", "Faceoff", "Offensive Play", "Defensive Play", "Transition", "Small Area Game"]
    ‚Ä¢ Net-front or down-low drills ‚Üí "Small Area Game"
    ‚Ä¢ Puck retrieval, regroups, transitions ‚Üí "Transition"
    ‚Ä¢ Pressuring defenders ‚Üí "Forecheck" or "Defensive Play"
    ‚Ä¢ Zone movement or rushes ‚Üí "Zone Entry"

Use only values from the lists above. If you're unsure, return an empty list [].

- hockey_skills: zero or more of ["Skating", "Passing", "Shooting", "Stickhandling", "Positioning", "Angling", "Gapping", "Forecheck", "Backcheck", "Shot Blocking", "Net Front Play", "Communication", "Timing"]

- complexity: one of ["Easy", "Intermediate", "Advanced"] ‚Äî based on what a 9‚Äì11 year old rep player can handle

Drill:
Title: {drill['title']}
Instructions: {drill.get('instructions', '')}
Teaching Points: {drill.get('teaching_points', '')}
Summary: {drill.get('summary', '')}
Tags: {', '.join(drill.get('tags', []))}

Respond in valid JSON with keys: position, starting_zone, ending_zone, situation, hockey_skills, complexity.
