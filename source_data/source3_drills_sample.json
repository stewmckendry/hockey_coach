    "instructions": "What\u2019s up guys!! I got an interesting email the other day from Mika from Australia. Because of the size of his local rink, and the limited number of players there, they play 3 on 3 (which sounds like a blast to me!). Anyways, he asked if I had any drills that focused on 3-man set-ups and game situations\u2026 this drill immediately came to mind!\nIt\u2019s a great drill for imitating odd-man rush scenarios, and is also GREAT conditioning for the forwards. Here\u2019s the explanation and diagram:\n3 on 0, 3 on 1, 3 on 2\n1. Forwards in one bench, Defensemen in the other2. On whistle, 3 Forwards swing low and receive a breakout pass from the Coach, then attack 3 on 03. After a quick attack, the same 3 Forwards swing to present themselves again for a breakout, while a Defenseman closes the gap.4. Coach initiates breakout and Forwards attack 3 on 1.5. After the 3 on 1, the same Forwards will swing again, receive athird breakout pass, then attack 3 on 2.\nEnjoy!",

    "instructions": "This small area game drill give players a chance to work on quick transitions, give and go passes and set-ups, and swinging to become a passing option. It\u2019s a fantastic drill that can be used by teams at almost any level! Here\u2019s the diagram:\n3 on 3 \u201cD\u201d Support\n1. Forwards battle 3 on 3 in NZ, but can\u2019t pass imaginary goal line.2. If puck passes goal line, respective defenseman must break it out (he can grab a new puck to keep up the pace).3. Forwards must swing to get open. Opposing forwards can pressure Defenseman, but can\u2019t cross line.4. Defenseman can\u2019t cross line either.\nEnjoy!",
