- **Foster Team Bonding and Fun**: Create an enjoyable environment for building camaraderie.

## Location and Amenities

## Session Structure
Each session splits into a **workout (1 hour)** and **ball hockey game (1 hour)**.

### Warm-Up (First 15 minutes)
- **Dynamic Stretching**: High knees, arm circles, and skips on the track to prepare for fast movements and prevent injuries.

### Workout Activities (45 minutes)
1. **Track Drills**
   - High-knee drills and ladder exercises to improve speed and footwork.
   - Timed sprints for building aerobic and anaerobic endurance.

2. **Hill Workouts**
   - Hill sprints and bounding to enhance lower body power and explosiveness.
   - Strength-building through skipping and two-footed hops.

3. **Field Circuits**
   - Core conditioning with exercises like bodyweight squats and lunges.
   - Agility drills with cones to boost coordination and quickness.

### Ball Hockey Game (1 hour)

## Progression Strategy
- **Weeks 1-4 (Foundation)**: Introduce basic skills and form-focused exercises. Build structure and routine.

- **Weeks 5-8 (Developmental)**: Elevate intensity, incorporating complex drills and longer intervals. Strengthen team dynamics through engaging ball hockey matches.

- **Weeks 9-12 (Peak Performance)**: Maximum effort in workouts with game-like scenarios. Monitor improvements with time trials and skill assessments.

## Team Bonding & Engagement
- **Weekly Challenges**: Include mini-competitions, such as fastest lap or best teamwork recognition, to motivate and engage players.

- **End-of-Season Event**: Organize a fun ‘Family Day’ to celebrate progress, with parents joining friendly games.

By leveraging Riverdale Park's amenities and fostering an inclusive, engaging environment, this workout plan aims to holistically develop the team's physical abilities and strengthen their collaborative spirit, ensuring readiness for the upcoming hockey season.
