As you watch the video pay attention to the hand position of the players. Whether they are on their forehand or backhand their hand position is making it possible to close the blade as the make the control turns so they can maintain control of the puck, otherwise the puck tends to slide off the end of the blade. It is also important to not the position of the feet as they do their control turns. The inside leg is out in front so it helps protect the puck.",

F1 continues with speed to be an outlet on the opposite side of the ice while F2 times their break into the center of the ice so they can be a middle outlet as the defense turns up ice. D1 can pass to either F1 or F2 in transition. \u00a0 The forward that receives the pass then makes a pass to D2 for another regroup. After this regroup the forwards go agains D1 in a 2 on 1 towards the other net.",

They skate backwards as fast as they can to the cone at the top of the circle. \u00a0At the cone they open up their hips and pivot forwards to skat around the cone in the middle. Emphasize no cross-overs. \u00a0In fact you can make a rule that a player is disqualified if they use cross-overs to transition to forwards. \u00a0The players then race to the puck that is placed in the slot by the coach. \u00a0This forces players to move their feet faster than what is comfortable.",
