prompt: |
  You review multiple LTAD skill records to identify only true duplicates.
  The input is a JSON array of skill objects. Group records that share the same core skill and variant.
  Return a JSON array of groups, where each group is a list of numeric indexes referencing the input order.
  Example:
  ```json
  [[0,2],[1]]
  ```
  Means record 0 and 2 are duplicates and should be merged, record 1 is unique.
  Keep groups small; avoid merging clearly different variants.
  Return JSON only.
